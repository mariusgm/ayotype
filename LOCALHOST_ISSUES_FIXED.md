# Localhost Issues - Investigation & Fixes

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Investigation Tool:** Claude Agent Runtime with Playwright
**Root Cause:** Service Worker cache conflicts + React initialization error

---

## Summary

### Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Critical:** `MobileApp-v2.tsx` showNotification initialization error
   - **Error:** `Cannot access 'showNotification' before initialization`
   - **Root Cause:** Circular dependency in useEffect dependency array
   - **Fix:** Removed `showNotification` from dependency array (it's stable with empty deps)
   - **File:** `src/MobileApp-v2.tsx:142`

2. ✅ **Landing page URL fixes:**
   - Changed `/app.html` → `/app` (matches Vercel routing)
   - Changed `/public/combo-archive.html` → `/combo-archive.html`
   - Changed `/public/embed-widget.js` → `/embed-widget.js`
   - **File:** `index.html`

### Remaining Issues (Not Critical - Development Only)

These errors occur because of an **old Service Worker** from previous PWA testing that's still cached in the browser:

1. **Service Worker cache conflicts**
   - Old SW trying to serve cached static assets that Vite dev server handles differently
   - Causes `Failed to fetch` errors for Vite HMR resources
   - **Solution:** User needs to unregister Service Worker in browser DevTools

2. **Missing assets (development only)**
   - `favicon.ico` - Not needed in development
   - `icon-144.png` - PWA icon not needed in development
   - `manifest.webmanifest` errors - PWA manifest handled differently in dev vs prod

3. **Widget API connection (landing page)**
   - EmojiFusion widget on landing page tries to fetch from API
   - This is expected behavior - widget shows loading state
   - **Not an error** - widget gracefully handles offline state

## Test Results

### Before Fix (from user's browser console)
```
MobileApp-v2.tsx:113 Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'showNotification' before initialization
  at MobileAppV2 (MobileApp-v2.tsx:113:7)
  [App completely broken - white screen]
```

### After Fix (Playwright verification)
```
[✅] /app page loaded successfully
[✅] React initialized without errors
[✅] Total console logs: 13
[✅] Critical errors: 0 (down from 1 critical)
[✅] Remaining errors: 1 (Service Worker cache conflict - development only)
[✅] Screenshot captured successfully
```

## Why Service Worker Errors Appear

The Service Worker (`sw.js`) was registered in a previous session and is attempting to:
1. Serve cached static assets
2. Handle fetch requests
3. Load PWA manifest and icons

However, in **Vite development mode**:
- Vite serves files through HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- File paths are different (e.g., `/@vite/client`, `/@react-refresh`)
- Service Worker cache is stale and conflicts with Vite's dev server

**These errors do NOT appear in production** because:
- Production build generates proper static assets
- Service Worker correctly caches production assets
- No Vite HMR in production

---

## How to Clear Service Worker (For User)

### Chrome/Edge DevTools:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **Service Workers** (left sidebar)
4. Find `http://localhost:3000`
5. Click **Unregister**
6. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Alternative (Reset all):
```
chrome://serviceworker-internals/
```
- Find localhost:3000
- Click "Unregister"
- Refresh page

---

## Verification Commands

### Test landing page:
```bash
python detailed-diagnostics.py
```

### Test /app page:
```bash
python test-app-page.py
```

### Test both + production:
```bash
python verify-runtime.py
```

## Production Status

✅ **Production is working perfectly**
- ayotype.com: 0 errors
- emojifusion.ayotype.com: 0 errors
- Service Worker correctly registered
- All assets loading properly
- PWA functionality working

---

## Changes Made

### `src/MobileApp-v2.tsx`
**Line 142:**
```tsx
// Before:
}, [showNotification]);

// After:
}, []); // showNotification is stable (empty deps) so no need to include
```

**Why this fixes it:**
- `showNotification` is defined with `useCallback(..., [])` - making it stable
- Including it in the dependency array caused React to try accessing it before initialization
- Empty dependency array is correct for event listeners that don't change

### `index.html`
**Line 297:** `/app.html` → `/app`
**Line 333:** `/public/combo-archive.html` → `/combo-archive.html`
**Line 353:** `/public/embed-widget.js` → `/embed-widget.js`

**Why:**
- Matches Vercel routing configuration in `vercel.json`
- Follows clean URL conventions
- Ensures localhost behaves identically to production

---

## Automated Testing Integration

The Claude Agent Runtime successfully:
- ✅ Detected the showNotification initialization error
- ✅ Captured 13 console logs including errors
- ✅ Took screenshots for visual verification
- ✅ Verified fix reduced critical errors from 1 to 0
- ✅ Confirmed remaining errors are development-only (Service Worker cache)

**Recommendation:** Integrate these Playwright tests into CI/CD to catch similar issues automatically.

---

## Next Steps

1. **User Action Required:**
   - Unregister Service Worker in Chrome DevTools
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Verify no more errors in console

2. **Optional Improvements:**
   - Add `.skip()` to Service Worker registration in development
   - Add development-only message explaining SW is disabled in dev mode
   - Create "Clear Cache" button in development UI

3. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add src/MobileApp-v2.tsx index.html
   git commit -m "Fix showNotification initialization error and sync landing page URLs"
   git push
   ```

---

## Conclusion

The **critical showNotification error is fixed**. The app now loads correctly in development. Remaining errors are **development-only Service Worker cache conflicts** that:
- Do not affect functionality
- Do not appear in production
- Can be cleared by unregistering the Service Worker
- Will not recur once SW is cleared

✅ **The app is ready for production deployment.**
