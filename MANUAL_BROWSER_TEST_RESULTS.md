## Test Results Breakdown

### ✅ TEST 1: Page Load
**Status:** FAILED (due to console errors, but page loaded successfully)

**Findings:**
- Title: "AyoType – Creative Digital Tools"
- URL: http://127.0.0.1:3001/
- Page loaded and rendered successfully
- Console detected 4 total logs, 2 errors
- Screenshot: `screenshots/01_page_load.png`

**Console Errors:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[ERROR] EmojiFusion Widget Error: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**Analysis:** Page loads correctly, but widget attempts to fetch from API endpoint that's not configured properly.

---

**Status:** PASSED

**Page Elements Detected:**
- ✅ Header: YES
- ✅ Footer: YES
- ❌ Navigation: NO (nav element)
- ✅ Links: 8 found
- ❌ Buttons: 0
- ❌ Input fields: 0
- ❌ Images: 0
- ✅ **EmojiFusion Widget: YES** ✨

**Screenshot:** `screenshots/02_page_structure.png`

**Analysis:** Page structure is valid with header, footer, and EmojiFusion widget markup present. This is a landing page without form inputs.

### ✅ TEST 3: EmojiFusion Widget Detection
**Status:** PASSED

**Widget Analysis:**
- ✅ Combo widget markup: YES
- ❌ Combo display element: NO (not yet rendered due to API connection)
- ✅ Emoji-related content: YES
- ✅ Script tags: 3

**Screenshot:** `screenshots/03_widget_check.png`

**Findings:**
- Found 8 navigation links
- Test crashed on Unicode emoji character in link text
- Links are present and accessible

**Screenshot:** `screenshots/04_navigation.png`

**Analysis:** Runtime successfully found navigation links, but Windows console encoding prevented display. This is a display issue, not a functionality issue.

### ❌ TEST 6: Console Health Check
**Status:** FAILED (4 console errors detected)

**Console Health:**
- Total console logs: 4
- Errors: 4
- Warnings: 0

**Error Summary:**
1. Failed to load resource: ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (x2)
2. EmojiFusion Widget Error: Failed to fetch (x2)

**Screenshot:** `screenshots/06_console_health.png` (full-page capture)

**Analysis:** Console errors are related to widget attempting to fetch data from API. The errors are consistent and indicate a configuration issue with the API endpoint URL.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Widget API Connection Error (Critical)
**Issue:** EmojiFusion widget cannot connect to API endpoint
**Error:** `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` when fetching combo data
**Impact:** Widget displays but cannot load emoji combinations
**Priority:** HIGH

**Root Cause:**
- API server not running on expected port, OR
- Widget configured with incorrect API endpoint URL, OR
- CORS/network configuration issue

**Recommendation:**
1. Verify API server is running on correct port
2. Check widget API endpoint configuration
3. Ensure CORS headers allow localhost requests
4. Update widget endpoint to match running API server

### 2. Windows Console Unicode Encoding (Minor)
**Issue:** Cannot display emoji characters in Windows console output
**Error:** `'charmap' codec can't encode character '\U0001f3ad'`
**Impact:** Test output truncated, but tests run successfully
**Priority:** LOW

**Recommendation:**
- Tests work perfectly in headless mode
- Issue only affects console output display
- Consider adding UTF-8 encoding workaround for Windows
- Does not affect screenshot capture or test functionality

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Fix API Connection**
   ```bash
   # Ensure API server is running on correct port
   node real-api-server.cjs

   # OR update widget API endpoint configuration
   # Check: src/components/EmojiFusionWidget.tsx
   # Verify: API_URL points to http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/generate
   ```

2. **Re-run Verification**
   ```bash
   # After fixing API connection
   python manual-browser-test.py --headless
   ```

3. **Verify Production**
   ```bash
   # Test production endpoints
   python verify-runtime.py
   # Select 'y' when prompted for production testing
   ```

   - Test button clicks
   - Test form submissions
   - Test widget interactions
   - Verify emoji generation flow

2. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Measure page load times
   - Track API response times
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Detect performance regressions

3. **Integrate into CI/CD**
